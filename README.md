Check your Understanding
1.
    1. With a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed seems to be the best option because it allows you to check for errors everytime you push a change in the code and you can fix your code in an iterative manner instead of doing it all at once at the end. Github actions allows you to automate the testing so it'll be uniform everytime instead of having to manually run tests which would consume way more time.


2. No

3. No you wouldn't because writing a message and sending a message are two separate functions and unit testing wouldn't help you debug any potential errors becasue we can't text the interation between these 2 functions.

4. Yes this is an ideal situation for unit testing. The message length would be a property of the message object and can be easily tested as it is not dependant on any of the other functions around it.
